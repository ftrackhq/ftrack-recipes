# Encode Image Sequences

This event overrides the default make_web_playable event hook provided
with ftrack-connect to enable the users to review image sequences by
converting them to videos.

## Scope

-   Subscribe to proper event with high priority
-   If image sequence, shoot a movie with ffmpeg and upload
-   Stop event so default hook doesn't run

## Install and setup

1.  Make the required executables available on the system path
2.  Please refer to the main ftrack-recipes python guide to enable the
    event listener

## Dependencies

-   ftrack_python_api
-   Requires ffmpeg available on the filesystem path.

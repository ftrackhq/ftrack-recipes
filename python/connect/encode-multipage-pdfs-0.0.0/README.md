# Encode Multipage PDFs

Currently, PDFs uploaded through Connect or the API are rendered as an
image. The new player supports paging through multipage PDFs, but
requires that the relevant Component have a certain metadata key. We
present here a replacement for the default hook in Connect which
replicates functionality found in the web UI.

## Scope

-   Subscribe to proper event with high priority
-   Upload and tag published PDF
-   Stop event so default hook doesn't run

## Install and setup

1\. Make the plugin available to the API either by setting the
FTRACK_EVENT_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable to
\<custom-location-folder\>. Alternatively use the plugin_paths in the
ftrack_api.Session constructor and point it to
\<custom-location-folder\>.

## Dependencies

# Customise Structure

When publishing files with the ftrack-python-api or ftrack Connect a
location plugin is used to determine where to write the output file.
This example can be as boilerplate when creating a custom location to be
used in ftrack Connect or through the API.

A location consist of an accessor that is used to read and write the
file from the storage, and a structure plugin that is used to generate
the target path given an ftrack component. In this example we use a
DiskAccessor from the ftrack-python-api, and a Structure plugin that we
have copied from the StandardStructure in the ftrack-python-api.

## Scope

-   Customise Structure
-   Register custom structure

## Install and setup

1\. Update the DISK_PREFIX variable in
\<custom-location-folder\>/location/custom_location_plugin.py to the
root path where you want to publish to.

2\. Make the location plugin available to the API either by setting the
FTRACK_EVENT_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable to
\<custom-location-folder\>. Alternatively use the plugin_paths in the
ftrack_api.Session constructor and point it to
\<custom-location-folder\>.

## Customise

To modify the file names and paths that are generated when you publish
to this location, you will want to modify the sturcture plugin's
get_resource_identifier method. The structure plugin is found in
location/structure.py.

# Cascade Thumbnails to Parent

When publishing a new asset, it could be convenient to have the
thumbnail of the newly published entity bubble up to the parent entity
and (optionally) associated task. This script will show you how to be
able to intercept thumbnail creation at publish time and set the same
thumbnail ID on related entities.

## Scope

-   Check thumbnails creation on AssetVersions.
-   Update the thumbnail on parent entities.

## Install and setup

1\. Make the cascade plugin available to the API either by setting the
FTRACK_EVENT_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable to
\<custom-location-folder\>. Alternatively use the plugin_paths in the
ftrack_api.Session constructor and point it to
\<custom-location-folder\>.

## Dependencies
